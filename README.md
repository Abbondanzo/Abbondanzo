### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! Iâ€™m Peter Abbondanzo, a UI/UX designer of web and mobile applications. Currently, I am studying at [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/) up in Boston, Massachusetts. Iâ€™ve got a passion for creating, innovating, and coffee. I also work for this fantastic company called [HubSpot](https://hubspot.com) over in Cambridge.

### What I do

I'm a computer scientist who likes to tinker with VR and web development in my spare time. I've helped write code for [replaying Rocket League games in the browser](https://github.com/SaltieRL/DistributedReplays) and made a [small VR rehabilitation game](https://github.com/NUVR/Magic-Mover). You can check out some of my older projects [here](https://abbondanzo.com/projects).

Mostly I'm a full-stack developer, building applications from the ground, up. If I'm not working on a project, you can find me bicycling around the Boston area, playing board/video games, or working on finishing my basement at home.

### How to reach me

I'm active on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pabbondanzo), Discord [[1]](https://discord.gg/GwM7RBY)[[2]](https://discord.gg/K3njNxF) and here on GitHub, so feel free to reach out.
